## What This Project Is

A workout tracker web application built as a learning project. The goal is to understand three-tier web architecture (database → server → browser client) by building something useful from scratch.

**Core features:**

- **Calendar-based logging** — home screen is a monthly calendar; click any date to log that day's workout. Dates with logged sets show a dot.
- **Workout split builder** — users create named training days (e.g. "Push Day"), assign exercises to each. My Split is structure-management only; all logging happens through the calendar.
- **Auto-save inputs** — weight and reps fields save automatically 600 ms after the user stops typing (no Log button). Revisiting a date pre-fills all inputs with previously logged values.
- **Quick Setup wizard** — recommends a split template (Push/Pull/Legs, Upper/Lower, Full Body, Bro Split) and sets rep ranges based on the user's goal (Strength or Hypertrophy).
- **Double progression engine** — add one rep per session until hitting the top of the rep range, then add weight and reset reps. Lives in pure Python with no DB calls.
- **Strength trend** — each session is reduced to an estimated 1RM using the Epley formula (`weight × (1 + reps/30)`), graphed over time per exercise.
- **CSV import** — import historical workout data via file upload or paste. Unknown exercises are created automatically. Import auto-creates an "Imported" workout day and sessions for each date.
- **Reset** — header button wipes all data from every table for a clean restart.
- **Stats page** — dedicated statistics view with four sections: Strength Progression (PRs, 1RM trends, recent PRs), Volume (weekly volume, working sets, muscle group breakdown), Consistency (streaks, workouts/week, GitHub-style heatmap), and Diagnostics (stalled lifts, muscle balance, exercise frequency). All computation lives in `server/stats.py` as pure functions.

## Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Database | SQLite (single `workout.db` file, created automatically) |
| Server | Python 3 + Flask (REST API + static file serving) |
| Client | Plain HTML + CSS + JavaScript (`fetch()` calls, no build step) |
| Charts | Chart.js v4.4.3 (CDN) |
| Tests | pytest |

## Running the App

**Always run from `Final-Project/`:**

```bash
# Install dependencies (one-time)
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the server
python -m flask --app server/app.py:create_app run
```

Then open **http://127.0.0.1:5000** in your browser.

> The app factory is `create_app` — use `server/app.py:create_app`, not just `server/app.py`.
> After any change to Python files, stop the server (Ctrl+C) and restart it. The auto-reloader does not always catch all changes.

## Database Schema

**`exercises`** — `id`, `name`, `rep_range_low`, `rep_range_high`, `weight_increment`, `created_at`

**`sets`** — `id`, `exercise_id` (FK → exercises), `date` (YYYY-MM-DD), `weight`, `reps`, `logged_at`

**`workout_days`** — `id`, `name`, `position`, `created_at`

**`workout_day_exercises`** — `id`, `workout_day_id` (FK → workout_days, ON DELETE CASCADE), `exercise_id` (FK → exercises), `position`; UNIQUE(workout_day_id, exercise_id)

**`workout_sessions`** — `id`, `date` (UNIQUE), `workout_day_id` (FK → workout_days, ON DELETE CASCADE), `created_at`

Schema is applied via `db.executescript(schema.sql)` on every new connection, so new tables are created automatically on first run.

---

## Key db.py Functions

- `upsert_set(db, exercise_id, date, weight, reps)` — deletes all sets for that exercise+date, inserts one new row. Used by the auto-save PUT endpoint so editing replaces rather than accumulates.
- `reset_all_data(db)` — deletes all rows from sets, workout_sessions, workout_day_exercises, workout_days, exercises in dependency order.
- `get_or_create_exercise(db, name, ...)` — looks up by name, inserts if missing. Used by import and setup.
- `get_or_create_imported_day(db)` — returns (or creates) the shared "Imported" workout day used by CSV import.
- `insert_session / get_session` — one session (workout type) per date; `INSERT OR REPLACE` semantics.
- `get_logged_dates_in_month(db, year, month)` — returns list of YYYY-MM-DD strings that have sets, used to draw calendar dots.

---

## server/stats.py

Pure functions — no DB calls, no Flask imports. Called by `GET /api/stats`.

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `compute_prs(history)` | Best weight, est. 1RM, and best reps per exercise |
| `compute_1rm_trend(history)` | Best Epley 1RM per calendar date, sorted |
| `compute_recent_prs(exercises_history, days=28)` | PRs whose all-time-best date is within last N days |
| `compute_weekly_volume(all_sets, num_weeks=12)` | Total weight×reps per week |
| `compute_working_sets_per_week(all_sets, num_weeks=12)` | Set count per week |
| `compute_category_totals(all_sets_with_category, num_weeks=12)` | Volume per muscle group; counts uncategorized separately |
| `compute_streaks(session_dates)` | Current and longest consecutive-day streaks |
| `compute_workouts_per_week(session_dates, num_weeks=12)` | Session count per week |
| `compute_heatmap(session_dates, num_weeks=52)` | One `{date, count}` per day for last 52 weeks |
| `compute_stalled_lifts(exercises_history, weeks=4)` | Exercises with <1% 1RM improvement in last N weeks |
| `compute_muscle_balance(all_sets_with_category, num_weeks=4)` | Volume share (%) per category |
| `compute_exercise_frequency(exercises_history, num_weeks=4)` | Sessions/week per exercise |

**Rule:** These functions must never make database calls or have side effects. Same constraint as `recommendation.py`.

**Category mapping:** Exercise names are matched against `PRESET_EXERCISES` in `presets.py` to assign Push/Pull/Legs/Core. Exercises not in the preset list have `category = None` and appear as "Other" in the UI. To get full category coverage, use exercise names that match the preset library.

## CSV Import Format

```
date,exercise,weight,reps
2025-01-15,Bench Press,135,8
2025-01-15,Bench Press,145,6
2025-01-17,Squat,185,5
```

- `date` — YYYY-MM-DD
- `exercise` — any name; created automatically if it doesn't exist
- `weight` — lbs, decimals ok; use `0` for bodyweight
- `reps` — whole number
- Multiple rows per exercise per date are allowed (import uses `insert_set`, not `upsert_set`)

**Prompt to give Claude for formatting raw notes into this CSV:**

> Convert the following workout log into a CSV with exactly these four columns in this order: `date,exercise,weight,reps`. Rules: date must be YYYY-MM-DD; exercise names capitalized consistently; weight in pounds (numbers only, use 0 for bodyweight); reps as whole numbers; one row per set; output only the raw CSV with no explanation or code fences. My workout data: [paste here]

---

## server/presets.py

Three exports:

- **`PRESET_EXERCISES`** — list of `{ name, category }` dicts (~34 exercises across Push / Pull / Legs / Core)
- **`SPLIT_TEMPLATES`** — list of `{ id, name, description, days: [{ name, exercises[] }] }` — 4 templates: `ppl`, `upper_lower`, `full_body`, `bro_split`
- **`REP_RANGES`** — `{ "strength": { rep_range_low:3, rep_range_high:6, weight_increment:5.0 }, "hypertrophy": { ..., 8, 12, 2.5 } }`

`SPLIT_TEMPLATES` is also duplicated in `client/app.js` as a JS constant so the Quick Setup wizard renders instantly without a network call.

---

## The Recommendation Engine

Lives entirely in `server/recommendation.py`. Three pure functions:

- **`recommend(history, rep_range_low, rep_range_high, weight_increment)`** — returns `{ weight, reps, note }`. Uses the last session's best set (highest reps; ties broken by heaviest weight). If best reps ≥ rep_range_high → add weight, reset to rep_range_low. Otherwise → same weight, reps+1.
- **`epley_1rm(weight, reps)`** — returns `weight * (1 + reps / 30)`.
- **`build_trend(history)`** — returns `[{ date, estimated_1rm }, ...]`, one entry per unique date.

**Rule:** These functions must never make database calls or have side effects.

---

## Testing Approach

32 tests across three tiers. Run with: `pytest tests/ -v`

- **Unit** (`test_recommendation.py`) — pure functions only, no DB, no Flask
- **Contract** (`test_api_contract.py`) — Flask test client + in-memory SQLite; verifies response shapes
- **Integration** (`test_integration.py`) — Flask test client + real temp `.db` file; verifies full vertical slices

All 32 tests must pass before committing.

---

## Development Rules for Claude

1. **Keep `recommendation.py` pure.** Never add a database import or network call to that file.
2. **Commit after each logical unit of work** and push to `origin main`.
3. **Update this file** when the project structure, API, or key decisions change.
4. **Target explanations at early undergrad level** — prefer clear code over clever abstractions.
5. **No premature abstraction** — three similar lines beat a helper function that isn't needed yet.
6. **`SPLIT_TEMPLATES` lives in two places** — `server/presets.py` (source of truth for the API) and `client/app.js` (duplicate for instant rendering). Keep them in sync when editing templates.
7. **Always restart the Flask server** after Python file changes — the dev auto-reloader does not always catch everything.
8. **Logging only through the calendar** — My Split (view-split / view-day) is structure management only. Never add log forms there.
9. **Auto-save uses upsert** — the session log uses `PUT /api/exercises/<id>/sets/<date>` (one set per exercise per date). Import uses `POST` (multiple sets allowed). Don't conflate the two.
10. **Keep `stats.py` pure** — same rule as `recommendation.py`. No DB imports, no Flask, no side effects. All data is passed in as plain Python lists/dicts.
